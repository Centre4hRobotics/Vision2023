## READ THIS ONLY IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.

    Whoever this may concern,

        These steps are here (just in case) Vision23 lacks manpower, one day (TM). As a main note, this document is for dummies.

        1) Make sure the robot is on.
        2) Connect to the robot's internet switch.
        3) Make sure you have VS Code
        4) Make sure you installed WPILib on VS Code
        5) Make sure you have installed PhotonVision using WPILib
        6) Restart VS Code, if it is not working
        7) Click on the WPILib Favicon (assuming it exists, but if it doesn't, try step 4 again.)
        8) Select 'WPILib: Deploy Robot Code'
        9) Wait. If you don't see the logs pop up on VS Code, go to step 10.
        10a) Assuming it doesn't work, google the error or whatever search engine vision23 is deciding to use.
        10b) Assuming it did work, congratulations! Don't touch a thing unless you are being supervised by a person who **ABSOLUTELY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING**.

        P.S. If none of the steps above work, start from scratch you caveman. 
        P.P.S The IP of the OrangePi (assuming vision23 is still using that board) should be 10.2.10.19

    Yours truly,
        The people who were responsible for the Vision23 codebase. We are not responsible for any headaches (TM).
